Current Phase: Phase 14ci - GitHub Actions CI Foundation

Latest Completed Implementation Phase: Phase 14.3 - Backend-Aware Snapshot Read Routing Boundary

Next Architecture Phase: BackendNode / BackendRegistry preparation

Roadmap Progress: see [Roadmap](docs/planning/roadmap.md)

---

VDR-Suite modernizes the Video Disk Recorder ecosystem with a backend service layer, daemon-owned state, snapshot architecture, REST APIs and future frontend integrations.

VDR remains the primary backend domain and source of truth.

VDR-Suite complements VDR. It does not replace it.

## Documentation Navigation Rule

The README is the repository entry point.

Every documentation page should provide navigation back to:

- [README](README.md)
- [Documentation Index](docs/index.md)
- [Project Overview](docs/project-overview.md)
- the local section index when applicable

This prevents documentation dead ends and keeps the documentation usable from GitHub, editors and local checkouts.

## Architecture Direction

VDR-Suite is designed to remain:

- VDR-centric
- backend-neutral
- service-oriented
- daemon-driven
- snapshot-oriented
- prepared for future multi-VDR environments
- suitable for future API consumers and frontends

---

## Implemented Areas

The project currently contains foundations for:

- SQLite persistence
- recording, metadata, job and action services
- dashboard services and JSON serialization
- REST controllers and API routing
- HTTP client/server abstractions
- VDR domain objects and adapter boundaries
- RESTfulAPI integration
- daemon-owned VDR snapshots
- snapshot cache and snapshot access services
- backend-aware snapshot access routing boundary
- change-state polling and partial snapshot refresh planning
- runtime logging, timing and diagnostics foundations
- snapshot read APIs
- snapshot change feed foundation
- GitHub Actions CI full regression test
