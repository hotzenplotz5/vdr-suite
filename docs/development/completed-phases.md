- BackendRegistry JSON serialization
- BackendRegistry controller
- BackendRegistry REST API routing
- backend-aware snapshot access
- backend-aware snapshot read service
- backend-aware VDR controller methods

- multi-snapshot cache foundation
- multi-backend snapshot cache access
- backend-aware snapshot builder

Verified with:

- make test-vdr-snapshot-builder
- make test-fast
- make daemon
- GitHub Actions validation

---

## Phase 16 - Multi-Backend Polling Foundation

Status: Completed through Phase 16.9

Result:

- backend-aware snapshot cache service updates
- backend-aware polling service
- backend polling coordinator
- backend runtime context foundation
- daemon runtime context migration
- coordinator runtime integration
- runtime context collection
- runtime context factory
- runtime context creation from registry
- backend-aware snapshot change feed service

Verified with:

- make test-backend-runtime-context
- make test-backend-polling-coordinator
- make test-snapshot-change-feed
- make test-fast
- make daemon

---

## Phase 17 - Multi-Backend Snapshot Read and REST Visibility

Status: Completed through Phase 17.3

Result:

- multi-backend snapshot read foundation
- multi-backend snapshot summary serialization
- multi-backend snapshots REST endpoint
- `GET /api/vdr/snapshots` exposes snapshot summaries for all cached backend snapshots
- multi-backend snapshots REST endpoint test coverage

Verified with:

- make test-vdr-snapshot-read-service
- make test-vdr-snapshot-read-json-serializer
- make test-snapshot-access-service
- make test-api-router
- make test-fast
- make test-docs
- make test-architecture
- make test-phase
- make daemon

---

## Phase 18 - Real VDR and RESTfulAPI Integration Validation

Status: Completed through Phase 18.4

Result:

- opt-in real RESTfulAPI integration validation
- opt-in real snapshot builder validation
- opt-in real change-state validation
- opt-in real polling initial snapshot validation
- opt-in real polling stability validation
- real VDR data verified through BasicHttpClient, RestfulApiVdrAdapter, VdrService, VdrSnapshotBuilder, PollingService, SnapshotCacheService and SnapshotRefreshPlanner
- repeated polling without VDR changes produces no change events and no refresh work

Verified with:

- make test-real-restfulapi-integration
- make test-real-snapshot-builder
- make test-real-change-state
- make test-real-polling-initial-snapshot
- make test-real-polling-stability
- make test-fast
- make test-docs
- make test-architecture
- make test-phase
- make daemon

---

## Next Work

Phase 19.0 should validate the snapshot change feed end-to-end before introducing live transport.

Goals:

- validate snapshot change feed creation from detected VDR changes
- validate backend-aware feed entries and snapshot generation references
- keep change feed validation transport-independent
- prepare SSE as a later consumer of the existing snapshot change feed
- preserve GitHub Actions compatibility without requiring a running VDR
