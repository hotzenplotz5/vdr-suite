# P2 First-Admin Bootstrap Boundary Audit

## Baseline

Audited against live `main`:

```text
1d4ec2bc4e481a8abbed4ab9fdcd65f9c3c40f74
```

An independent open workstream owns the Public-v1 Account collection. This slice deliberately does not modify its runtime, API, client or Phase-69 compatibility surfaces.

## Current deployment facts

The packaged daemon unit sources:

```text
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/vdr-suite-daemon
```

The packaged defaults file contains operational daemon settings but no first-admin claim lifecycle.

`SecurityConfiguration` still falls back to:

```text
VDR_SUITE_SECURITY_MODE -> legacy-basic
```

and the compatibility credential remains available when no migration configuration is supplied.

## Current persistence facts

The Suite security database already owns:

- Actors;
- Human Accounts;
- Devices;
- Sessions;
- Credentials;
- Basic credential verifiers;
- permission grants;
- accountability events.

`SecurityIdentityProvisioningRepository` can create identity rows and `CredentialVerifierRepository` persists one-way password verifiers.

These are reusable primitives, but neither repository defines first-admin claim ownership, single-use bootstrap lifetime, claim atomicity or local recovery policy.

## Missing product lifecycle

Current main does not provide a canonical lifecycle equivalent to:

```text
fresh install
 -> unclaimed
 -> local operator bootstrap issuance
 -> short-lived setup proof
 -> first Human Account + admin grants
 -> claimed
 -> bootstrap permanently invalid
```

There is also no canonical local Human Account recovery contract that can replace a lost credential without revealing the stored verifier.

## Root cause

The remaining blocker to retiring the compatibility default is not missing password verification.

It is missing lifecycle authority around:

- whether the server is claimed;
- who may issue setup authority;
- how bootstrap material expires and becomes single-use;
- how first Human Account creation is atomic;
- how administrator grants are established;
- how an operator recovers access;
- how upgrades avoid locking out existing installations.

Therefore changing `legacy-basic` today would be a deployment behavior change without a safe replacement path.

## First justified runtime successor

After ADR-0066 acceptance, the smallest runtime slice is persistent claim/bootstrap state in the existing Suite database with:

- explicit unclaimed/claimed determination;
- short-lived bootstrap verifier metadata;
- single-use/expiry state;
- no plaintext bootstrap secret persistence;
- no HTTP endpoint yet;
- no authentication-default change yet.

The local issuance command and atomic first-admin claim service follow as separate slices.
